# Sharing your code

Sharing your code is essential for making your research open and reproducible, it allows other researchers to build on your work, to understand it and to verify your findings.

## Why you should use open source tools

One aspect to consider even before creating your code is to think which programming language you would like to use.
The vast majority of programming languages are open source, that means that you have access to their source code and that they are free to use.</b>  
This means that you can create and share code and that anyone else can freely use it. On the contrary proprietary programming languages and softwares will require the user to buy a license or to use a license from their institution, thus contravening to the fundamental openess principle of science.

## Document your code

Documenting your code is a favor that you do to yourself and any other potential user. Although it might seem a waste of precious time, it is going to save you time in the future when you will not remember why you made certain decisions in your code and you will need to spend additional time only to figure that out.

**Comment your code:** The best way to start documenting your code is to comment each essential piece of it while your are still writing the code:

- Provide explanations about inputs and outputs for functions and classes according to the language style.
- Provide a short examples that the user can easily run.
- Provide explanations for lines of code that might have some critical issues, or some peculiarity that might be hard to figure out only by reading the code.

**README file:** Create a README file as markdown, it is one of the most common way to document your code. It should include:
- A brief introduction explaining the scope of your code.
- Installation procedure, if needed, dependencies (libraries needed by your code to run) and requirements (e.g. specific version of the programming language).
- A simple description of the structure of your code.
- A working example of your code.
- Do not forget to cite your sources.

## Github and other similar platforms
*******
Github and Gitlab are just a few of the platforms that allow code sharing, such platforms, however, are not just public storages for hosting your code, but they are tools for collaborative projects. The advantage of using such platforms during your research are diverse.

- It allows to share and document your code whith your publication.
- They rely on `git`, meaning that you can modify and keep track of your code locally through git and transfer (`push`) your changes to the version of your code hosted on Github or other platforms.
- It allows to easily work on the same project with your collaborators.
- It gives you a free and safe backup for your code.
- It allows you to have private projects that only you and your collaborators can see.
- If your repository is public it allows other people to use your code and help you and find potential issues.
